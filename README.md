**The store changed the procedure for buying items, but this did not affect the performance of the extension!**
This is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to track current and median item price on CSGOTM. Moreover, PriceHelper™ calculates the percentage difference while transfering items between Steam™ and CSGOTM™.

The information on prices is shown in individual container right under the main item price on CSGOTM™ <https://market.csgo.com>
***
PriceHelper™ is a open-source project, so before installing it you have the opportunity to make yourself clear it is safe to use it and your items will not be stolen.

PriceHelper™ is not published in Chrome Extensions. The safe copy of PriceHelper™ is available in this repository. New additions will be published here, you can download them following the instruction below.

CSGOTM™ is a fully Russian platform so PriceHelper™ could not work with some items, name of which is written in Russian.

How to fix it?

There is dictionary in lib folder in project's root, which contains the majority of items represented on CSGOTM™. You can add new names, that have not been translated recently, to this dictionary locally. Items translations can be found on <https://csgoitems.pro>. It is necessary to follow the structure of the dictionary.
